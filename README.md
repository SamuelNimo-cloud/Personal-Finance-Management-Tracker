Personal Finance Management Tracker 💰

A simple Python-based application designed to help users track their income and expenses, calculate daily spending limits, and build better financial awareness. This project focuses on core programming fundamentals and clean logic rather than complex frameworks.

📌 Project Overview

The Personal Finance Management Tracker allows users to:

Input their income or weekly allowance

Record different types of expenses

Calculate how much they can spend per day

Convert values between pounds and pence

Prevent invalid inputs such as negative numbers

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of Python basics, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving through code.
